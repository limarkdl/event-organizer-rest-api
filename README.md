# Event Organizer System

##  About
This is University Assignment where I'm supposed to implement RESTful API with `Express.js`, `SQLite` with use of any `ORM` and `EJS`. Also `Postman` tests are needed to be implemented.

The purpose of this API is an event organizing system.

> Dev version uses `nodemon` and on each save it restarts
